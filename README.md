# Front-end task

Hey there!

Thanks for joining recruitment for Front-end dev @ netguru. We’ve a small task for you!

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netguru/frontend-recruitment-task/master/sources/hangman.png)

This is simple Hangman game (you can find PSD in [sources](https://github.com/netguru/frontend-recruitment-task/tree/master/sources) directory). Can you make this stuff work?

Use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) as playground (create an account and create new pen, once you’re done send us link to your work). You can use any different platform if you want, (for example [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com)), but please remember that:
+ your game should work out of the box (we should click link and be able to play)
+ we should be able to take a look at your code :)

You can also create it as a regular project, using your favourite build tools, structure and so on. Doing so, please deploy your application somewhere, where we can check how it works. Also please send us .zip with the whole project, so we can easily review your code.

### Rules & hints
1. Use real API for fetching random word. [Wordnik](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html#!/words) could be great for that.
2. There should be no folk at game beginning. Game ends once folk earns left foot (see diverted flow below).

3. You can write your game in pure JS or use framework of your choice (React, Ember or Angular preferred).
4. You should write styles in SASS (using SCSS syntax).
5. Using ES6 is a huge plus.
6. Pay attention to code quality, formating, conventions etc. (this really matters, check your code twice before you send a solution)
7. You can find cropped images in images directory, but try not to use use all of them (CSS power!).
8. Make use of keyboard as controller.
9. Game over screen is available in [sources](https://github.com/netguru/frontend-recruitment-task/tree/master/sources) directory.
10. Remember about users with retina screens.
11. Provided design concerns retina screens and thus it's bigger, in reality it is twice as small - so the white box should be 810x490px

**Good luck! If you have any questions feel free to ping us!**
